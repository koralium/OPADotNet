Authorization methods
======================

There are multiple different ways to authorize either calls, resources or views.

The framework builds upon how authorization is done in `AspNetCore <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/introduction?view=aspnetcore-5.0>`_.

If you want to see an example of different authorization methods in use, please visit `MvcExample <https://github.com/koralium/OPADotNet/tree/main/samples/MvcExample>`_.
